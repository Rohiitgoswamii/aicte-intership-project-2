This system uses advanced AI and image recognition to detect plant diseases early, helping farmers identify issues like infections, nutrient deficiencies, and pest damage before they spread. It provides instant, accurate diagnoses and recommends sustainable, eco-friendly solutions to protect crops and improve yields—all while reducing reliance on harmful chemicals.
